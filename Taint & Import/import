The terraform import command in Terraform is used to associate an existing resource with a configuration managed by Terraform.

This command is particularly useful when you have resources that were created outside of Terraform, and you want to start managing them using Terraform without recreating them.

terraform import <Terraform Resource Identifier> <Provider Resource Identifier>

terraform import aws_instance.example i-0123456789abcdef0
