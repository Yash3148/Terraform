# In Terraform, the taint command is used to mark a resource instance as "tainted" within your infrastructure. 

# Tainting a resource means that you have identified a specific resource that you want Terraform to recreate during the next apply operation. 

#This is often used when you want to force Terraform to destroy and recreate a resource due to issues or changes in the configuration that can't be handled by a simple update.

terraform taint <resource_type>.<resource_name>
