Terraform remote state refers to the storage and management of Terraform's state files in a location that is separate from your local workspace.

Terraform uses state files to keep track of the resources it manages, their current status, and the relationships between them.

Remote state allows multiple users and Terraform runs to collaborate on the same infrastructure project and keep their state files synchronized.

# terraform state <subcommand> [options] [args]

subcommand ---> list, mv, pull, rm, show

# terraform state rm local_file.hall_of_fame

# terraform state mv random_pet.super_pet_1 random_pet.ultra_pet
Here we are changing the resource name from super_pet_1 to ultra_pet  --> It will change it in state file.
